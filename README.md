It looks like the notebook doesn't contain any markdown content (like titles, section headers, or descriptions), which usually help describe the structure and purpose of the analysis. That means I’ll build a **detailed `README.md`** based on inspecting the code cells and inferring the analysis steps.

Let me extract and analyze the code cells to understand what the notebook does.


Thanks for waiting. Based on the notebook content, here's a **detailed `README.md`** that reflects what your notebook does:

# 🦠 Covid-19 Analysis & Visualization

This project presents an interactive and visual exploration of the Covid-19 pandemic using Python data analysis and visualization libraries. It uses two datasets to examine global trends in Covid-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries.

## 📘 Project Description

The notebook provides insights into:

- Data acquisition and inspection from two CSV datasets (`covid.csv`, `covid_grouped.csv`)
- Data cleaning and transformation
- Descriptive statistics
- Visual analytics using interactive and static plots
- Country-specific case trends
- Time-series visualizations
- Correlation between key indicators

## 📁 Datasets Used

1. **covid.csv**
   - Raw time-series Covid-19 data
   - Includes fields like `Date`, `Country`, `Confirmed`, `Deaths`, `Recovered`, `NewCases`, `NewDeaths`, `NewRecovered`

2. **covid_grouped.csv**
   - Aggregated Covid-19 data by date and country
   - Pre-processed for group-wise trend analysis

> These datasets should be placed in the same directory as the notebook to ensure it runs properly.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Libraries

- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas** – data loading and preprocessing
- **Matplotlib** – basic data visualization
- **Plotly (Express + Graph Objects)** – interactive plots, tables, animations
- **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab** – interactive analysis platform

## 📊 Key Features

### 1. 📂 Data Loading & Inspection
- Loads datasets using `pandas.read_csv()`
- Summarizes structure using `.shape`, `.info()`, `.head()`
- Drops unnecessary columns (`NewCases`, `NewDeaths`, `NewRecovered`)

### 2. 📉 Data Cleaning
- Basic filtering and selection
- Sample data views
- Prepares clean input for visualizations

### 3. 📋 Tabular Summary
- Uses `plotly.figure_factory.create_table()` to render an interactive summary table with color scales

### 4. 📈 Visualizations (in later cells)
The notebook includes a wide range of visualizations, such as:

- Time-series line charts for confirmed cases and deaths
- Bar charts of top-affected countries
- Heatmaps showing distribution patterns
- Interactive tables and graphs with Plotly
- Possibly choropleth maps (depending on later content)

## 🚀 How to Run

### Requirements

Ensure the following libraries are installed:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib plotly
````

### Steps

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open `Covid-19 Analysis & Visualization.ipynb` in Jupyter or upload to Google Colab.
3. Ensure `covid.csv` and `covid_grouped.csv` are present in the same folder.
4. Run all cells step-by-step.
